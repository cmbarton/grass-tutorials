The workshop showcases GRASS tools for satellite imagery processing and analysis,
covering workflows from data acquisition to supervised classification and visualization. 
It is all contained in a Jupyter Notebook using GRASS Python interface and can be run
in Google Colab, so no local software installation is required.
